#### Hey! I'm Ryan, a Masters in Environmental Science & Management (MESM) student at URI specializing in _Wetland, Watershed, and Ecosystems science._ I'm also getting graduate certificates in Hydrology and GIS/Remote Sensing. Currently, I work for MassDOT as an Environmental Co-op in their Highway Divison doing environmental permitting. 
I want to thank @marecotec for a great course! :sunglasses:
