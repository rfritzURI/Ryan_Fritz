# 2. Push sys.argv to the limit
# Construct a rudimentary Python script that takes a series of inputs as a command from a bat file using sys.argv,
# and does something to them. The rules:
#
# Minimum of three arguments to be used.
# You must do something simple in 15 lines or less within the Python file.
# Print or file generated output should be produced.

# All right let's do this
import sys

print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[1]))
print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[2]))
print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[3]))
print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[4]))
print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[5]))
print("My Friends: " + str(sys.argv[6]))
